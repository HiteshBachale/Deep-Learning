# Deep Learning: Overview

📌 What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that focuses on training artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep"). It enables computers to automatically learn representations from large amounts of data without relying heavily on manual feature engineering. Inspired by the human brain, deep learning models can recognize patterns, classify data, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

📜 History of Deep Learning

1943 – McCulloch & Pitts developed the first mathematical model of a neuron.

1950s–60s – Perceptron model introduced by Frank Rosenblatt, marking the beginning of neural networks.

1970s–80s – Neural networks faced the “AI Winter” due to limited computational power and lack of data.

1986 – Backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart, Hinton, Williams) reignited research in multi-layer neural networks.

1990s – Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by Yann LeCun successfully applied to digit recognition (LeNet-5).

2006 – Geoffrey Hinton’s breakthrough in deep belief networks popularized the term Deep Learning.

2012 – AlexNet (deep CNN) won the ImageNet competition, reducing error rates significantly and fueling global interest.

2014–present – Rapid advancements in deep architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, Transformers (BERT, GPT), revolutionizing fields from computer vision to natural language processing.
